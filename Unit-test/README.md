# Unit test

## Introduction

gRPC is a high-performance open-source framework developed by Google for building efficient and scalable client-server communication systems. It utilizes the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) language to define the structure of the messages and services, providing a flexible and language-agnostic approach to communication.


I successfully conducted comprehensive unit testing on the gRPC server, meticulously examining its functionalities and ensuring a robust codebase. By diligently crafting 111 test cases, I achieved an exceptional coverage rate of 100%. This rigorous testing approach not only guarantees the reliability and stability of the server but also instills confidence in its performance.
